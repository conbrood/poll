Code Review by Matthew Morris
I think by far the best aspect of my partner's is how neat it is, it is very neat and originized, making it very easy to dig through it.
Though overall the code was great, the biggest errors i could find was unfinished code in the if_else.sh, and i also couldnt find the for loop.
My advice for my partner would be to correct the if_else.sh, to finish the rest of the code and to add the echo command. Next I would also advise my partner to add a for loop,
i searched through all of the files but i couldnt find it.
